# Basics-Of-Machine-Learning-And-Algorithms

1)Make sure you have anaconda and libraries like numpy, matplotlib, pandas and sklearn installed.
  https://www.anaconda.com/download/

2)In anaconda we will be using Spyder.Spyder is an interactive Python development environment providing MATLAB-like features in a simple and light-weighted software. It also provides ready-to-use pure-Python widgets to your PyQt5 or PyQt4 application: source code editor with syntax highlighting and code introspection/analysis features, NumPy array editor, dictionary editor, Python console, etc.

3)We will start from the very scratch in this journey.We will be covering:-
  Data Processing
  Regression
  Classification
  Clustering
  Different Forms Of Learning
  Natural Language Processing
  Deep Learning
  Dimensionality Reduction
  Model Selection & Boosting
